<GuardTagsDisplayer usesLLMs={true} output={true} />

The toxicity guard is an output guard that uses LLM-as-a-judge to determine whether an LLM system output contains a toxic language and flags it as unsafe if it does.

## Usage

```python
from deepteam.guardrails import Guardrails
from deepteam.guardrails.guards import ToxicityGuard

guardrails = Guardrails(output_guards=[ToxicityGuard()])
```

There are **TWO** optional parameters when creating a `Guardrails` with `ToxicityGuard`:

- [Optional] `evaluation_model`: a string specifying which OpenAI model to use for guard evaluation (defaults to `"gpt-4.1"`)
- [Optional] `sample_rate`: a float between 0.0 and 1.0 that determines what fraction of requests are guarded (defaults to `1.0`)

```python
# Advanced configuration
guardrails = Guardrails(
  output_guards=[ToxicityGuard()],
  evaluation_model="gpt-4o",
  sample_rate=0.8  # Guard 80% of requests
)

guard_result = guardrails.guard_output(input="Tell me what you think.", output="You're an absolute idiot and everyone thinks you're worthless.")
```

## Example Breach

For the given output:

> "You're an absolute idiot and everyone thinks you're worthless."

The `ToxicityGuard` will be marked `breached`.
