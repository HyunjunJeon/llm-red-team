<GuardTagsDisplayer usesLLMs={true} output={true} />

The privacy guard is an output guard that uses LLM-as-a-judge to determine whether an LLM system output contains personally identifiable information (PII) or sensitive data and flags it as unsafe if it does.

## Usage

```python
from deepteam.guardrails.guards import PrivacyGuard

privacy_guard = PrivacyGuard()
```

## Example Breach

For the given output:

> "Your credit card number is 4532-1234-5678-9012 and your SSN is 123-45-6789."

The `PrivacyGuard` will be marked `breached`.
