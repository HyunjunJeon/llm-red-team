<GuardTagsDisplayer usesLLMs={true} output={true} />

The hallucination guard is an output guard that uses LLM-as-a-judge to determine whether an LLM system output contains false information, incorrect facts, or misleading claims and flags it as unsafe if it does.

## Usage

```python
from deepteam.guardrails import Guardrails
from deepteam.guardrails.guards import HallucinationGuard

guardrails = Guardrails(output_guards=[HallucinationGuard()])
```

There are **TWO** optional parameters when creating a `Guardrails` with `HallucinationGuard`:

- [Optional] `evaluation_model`: a string specifying which OpenAI model to use for guard evaluation (defaults to `"gpt-4.1"`)
- [Optional] `sample_rate`: a float between 0.0 and 1.0 that determines what fraction of requests are guarded (defaults to `1.0`)

```python
# Advanced configuration
guardrails = Guardrails(
  output_guards=[HallucinationGuard()],
  evaluation_model="gpt-4o",
  sample_rate=0.8  # Guard 80% of requests
)

guard_result = guardrails.guard_output(input="When was the Declaration of Independence signed?", output="The Declaration of Independence was signed on July 4, 1776 by George Washington, who was the first President elected in 1789.")
```

## Example Breach

For the given output:

> "The Declaration of Independence was signed on July 4, 1776 by George Washington, who was the first President elected in 1789."

The `HallucinationGuard` will be marked `breached`.
